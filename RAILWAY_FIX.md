# Fix Railway Deployment Crash

## ðŸš¨ Problem
Railway is crashing with "Error creating build plan with Railpack" because it's trying to build the entire Flutter project.

## âœ… Solution: Use the Clean Server Directory

I've created a clean server directory at `server-deploy/` that contains only the Node.js files.

### **Option 1: Deploy from Clean Directory (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Railway** and create a new project
2. **Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select your `skimpulse_app` repository**
4. **Set Root Directory to `/server-deploy`**
5. **Deploy** - this should work perfectly!

### **Option 2: Manual Upload (If Option 1 fails)**

1. **Go to Railway** and create a new project
2. **Choose "Upload from your computer"**
3. **Upload the `server-deploy` folder** (zip it first if needed)
4. **Deploy**

### **Option 3: Create Separate GitHub Repo (Most Reliable)**

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (e.g., `skimpulse-api`)
2. **Copy files from `server-deploy/` to the new repo**
3. **Deploy the new repo to Railway**

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

- âœ… **No Flutter files** to confuse Railway
- âœ… **Clean Node.js structure**
- âœ… **Proper package.json**
- âœ… **No build conflicts**

## ðŸ“± Your Flutter App

Your Flutter app remains completely unchanged and ready for:
- âœ… **App Store deployment**
- âœ… **Google Play Store deployment**
- âœ… **All Flutter features intact**

## ðŸ”§ After Deployment

1. **Get your server URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. **Update Flutter app**: `./update_server_url.sh "https://your-app.railway.app"`
3. **Test your app**
4. **Deploy to app stores!**

**Try Option 1 first - it should work perfectly now!** ðŸš€
