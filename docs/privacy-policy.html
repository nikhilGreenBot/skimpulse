        <p class="subtitle">Skimpulse - What's Hot from Skimfeed</p>
        
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>
        
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes the data practices of Skimpulse ("we", "our", or "us") when you use 
            our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring 
            transparency about our data practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Skimpulse itself does not collect, store, or have access to any personal 
            information. However, Google AdMob (our advertising provider) may automatically collect certain 
            information for advertising purposes. This policy explains what information AdMob may collect and 
            how you can control it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>
            Skimpulse does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the app. 
            We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
            Skimpulse itself does not collect any information automatically. However, Google AdMob (our advertising provider) may automatically collect certain information when you use the app. This information is collected by Google AdMob, not by us, and is used for advertising purposes. The types of information that AdMob may collect include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device type, operating system version, and device identifiers (see Section 3 below).</li>

            <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> Your IP address and network connection type.</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Note:</strong> We do not have access to or control over the information collected by Google AdMob. This data collection is handled entirely by Google according to their privacy policy.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        
        <p>
            Skimpulse itself does not collect, store, or use your personal information. However, Google AdMob (our advertising provider) automatically collects certain information to display relevant advertisements. This information is collected and used by Google AdMob according to their privacy practices, not by us directly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. Any data collection that occurs is done automatically by Google AdMob for advertising purposes only, as described in Section 3 below.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>
            Skimpulse uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may automatically collect and use 
            information about your device to provide personalized ads. This information is collected by Google 
            AdMob, not by us, and may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers)</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Device type and operating system</li>
            <li>Ad interaction data (clicks, views, etc.)</li>
            <li>General location data (approximate, not precise)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> AdMob does not track which specific articles you read or your browsing 
            activity within the app. It only collects data related to advertisements.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For more information about how Google uses data, please visit:
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.2 Content Sources</h3>
        <p>
            Skimpulse aggregates content from Skimfeed.com. When you click on articles, you will be directed to 
            external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. 
            Please review their privacy policies separately.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        
        <p>
            Since Skimpulse does not collect or store any personal information, there is no data security 
            concern related to our app. However, Google AdMob handles data security for the information they 
            collect. For information about Google's data security practices, please refer to their 
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>
            Skimpulse is not intended for children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal 
            information, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. However, 
            Google AdMob may collect information from users of all ages for advertising purposes. Parents and 
            guardians can help protect children's privacy by using device settings to limit ad tracking, as 
            described in Section 3.1.
        </p>
        
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        
        <p>
            Since Skimpulse does not collect, store, or have access to any personal information, there is no data collected by us that you can access or request deletion of.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, you can control advertising-related data collection by Google AdMob:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Advertising:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
                    <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>AdMob Data:</strong> If you wish to access or delete data collected by Google AdMob, you will need to contact Google directly, as we do not have access to this information.
